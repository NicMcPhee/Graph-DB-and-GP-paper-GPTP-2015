 	abstract =     "Several genetic programming researchers have argued
 	for the utility of genetic operators that act
 	uniformly. By act uniformly we mean two specific
 	things: that the probability of an inherited program
 	component being modified during inheritance is
 	independent of the size and shape of the parent
 	programs beyond the component in question; and that
 	pairs of parents are combined in ways that allow
 	arbitrary combinations of components from each parent
 	to appear in the child. Uniform operators described in
 	previous work have had limited utility, however,
 	because of a mismatch between the relevant notions of
 	uniformity and the hierarchical structure and variable
 	sizes of many genetic programming representations. In
 	this chapter we describe a new genetic operator, ULTRA,
 	which incorporates aspects of both mutation and
 	crossover and acts approximately uniformly across
 	programs of variable sizes and structures. ULTRA treats
 	hierarchical programs as linear sequences and includes
 	a repair step to ensure that syntax constraints are
 	satisfied after variation. We show that on the drug
 	bioavailability and Pagie-1 benchmark problems ULTRA
 	produces significant improvements both in
 	problem-solving power and in program size relative to
 	standard operators. Experiments with factorial
 	regression and with the Boolean 6-multiplexer problem
 	demonstrate that ULTRA can manipulate programs that
 	make use of hierarchical structure, but also that it is
 	not always beneficial. The demonstrations evolve
 	programs in the Push programming language, which makes
 	repair particularly simple, but versions of the
 	technique should be applicable in other genetic
 	programming systems as well.",
