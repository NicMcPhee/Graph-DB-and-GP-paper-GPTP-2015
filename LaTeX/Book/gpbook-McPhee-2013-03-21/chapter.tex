\section{Note to early reviewers}

\emph{
This is definitely still very much a work in progress, and we apologize for its incompleteness. 
We're still working through small bits of the many, many gigabytes of data that we have access to, 
looking for good stories to tell. Hopefully, however, this will give a sense of our goals, plan, 
and some of our early results. We'd certainly love feedback on which of these stories you feel are 
the most interesting, informative, and ultimately helpful for the community, as well as any 
suggestions you have regarding the telling of the stories.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

It is common practice in most empirical evolutionary computation (EC) 
research\marginpar{It would be nice to scrape, say, the GECCO 2014 proceedings and get some 
	numbers to back this up.} to perform numerous (possibly hundreds) of runs, and then simply 
report a handful of aggregate statistics at the end that are expected to summarize and represent 
the (hopefully) complex interactions and dynamics of those many runs. Tables present values such 
as mean or median best fitnesses at the end of runs, collapsing the complexities of dozens or 
hundreds of runs into a single number, possibly with a standard deviation or (even better) a 
confidence interval to give a sense of the distribution. Often more informative are plots, which can, 
for example, show how these numbers change over time during the runs, possibly giving a sense of 
the system dynamics. These plots, however, often aggregate runs in a way that obscure important 
moments that, if explored, might reveal valuable insight into the evolutionary dynamics being 
reported.\marginpar{Perhaps include a sample plot and show how it hides things? One of Tom's 
	diversity or cluster plots? A synthetic plot? Maybe that's just not necessary?}

While this sort of aggregate reporting is often valuable, allowing for important comparative
analysis of, for example, the impact of different genetic operators, it typically fails to provide
any sense of the \emph{why}. Yes, Treatment A led to better aggregate performance than 
Treatment B -- but what happened in the runs that led to that result? Any success at the end of a
run is ultimately the intricate combination of hundreds or thousands of selections, recombinations
and mutations, and if Treatment A is in some sense ``better'' than Treatment B, it must ultimately
be because it affected all those genealogical and genetic events in some significant way, biasing them
towards events that made success more likely. 

Unfortunately, published research very rarely includes information that might shed light on 
these \emph{why} events. We rarely see evolved programs, for example, or any kind of post-run analysis
of those programs, and there is almost never any data or discussion of the genealogical history that
might help us understand how a successful program actually came to be. 

Sometimes this isn't included
for reasons of space and time; evolved programs, for example, are often extremely large and complex,
and a meaningful presentation and discussion of such a program could easily take up more space than
authors have available given the typical space limitations in published work.
Our suspicion, however, is that this sort of \emph{why} analysis often isn't reported because it isn't 
even \emph{done}, in no small part because it's hard. As EC researchers we're in the
``happy'' position of being able to collect anything and everything that happens in a run, but that 
leaves us with two problems: How to \emph{store} the data, and how to \emph{analyze} the data
after it's stored. Decreasing data storage costs have done much to mitigate the first problem.
If, however, one collects a very rich data set it's still easy to quickly generate terabytes of data,
and even if one has a place to put the data, one still needs reasonable tools to analyze the data.

Databases provide a natural tool for storing and accessing the data, but traditional relational
databases are poorly suited for a variety of queries that are important for the genealogical analysis
we need for exploring the evolutionary dynamics of our EC runs. If, for example, we have a 
\texttt{ParentChild} table, it's easy enough to find Alice's parents, but finding Alice's grandparents,
siblings, or cousins requires multiple joins. Moving further out in Alice's tree of relatives
requires complex and computationally expensive recursive joins, making this approach increasingly
infeasible. In exploring the dynamics of an EC run, for example, we're going to want to be able to
make connections across dozens or even hundreds of generations, which simply isn't feasible with a
relational database. (See, for example, \cite{Robinson:GraphDB:Book} for more on these 
feasability/efficiency issues.)

In this chapter we illustrate the use of graph databases as an alternative storage and analysis tool for
evolutionary computation runs. In \cite{donatuccianalysis} we have demonstrated that graph databases
can be an effective tool for analyzing complex genetic programming (GP) dynamics, which led directly
to a proposed change to standard sub-tree crossover in tree-based GP, \cite{mcphee:GECCO15}.
Here we will use the open source Neo4J graph database tool\footnote{\url{http://neo4j.com/}} 
to explore data from a
collection of PushGP runs on several problems drawn from a benchmark collection of introductory 
programming problems taken from \cite{helmuth:GECCO15}.

\section{Surprising fecundity (especially given that total error)}
\label{sec:surprisingFecundity}

% This is run 6, lexicase, replace-space-with-newline.

Lexicase selection (\cite{helmuth:IEEE}) was designed in significant part with the intent of 
increasing and maintaining diversity. The key assumption was that it would distribute the selection 
events across a variety of groups of individuals, as the population separates into sections focusing
on different subsets of the test cases. As \cite{helmuth:GPTP15} shows, this is to a significant
degree a ``true'' (or at least reasonable) story, with lexicase generally leading to more diversity
than either tournament selection or implicit fitness sharing.

A flip side of that assumption was that individuals probably didn't have disproportionately 
large numbers of offspring, as the selections are being spread out across these different groups
of individuals. In exploring one lexicase run on the Replace Space With Newlines problem, however,
we discovered that while in general this story held true, there were moments in the course of the run
where the reality was \emph{wildly} different.

\section{Section Heading}
\label{sec:1}
% Always give a unique label
% and use \ref{<label>} for cross-references
% and \cite{<label>} for bibliographic references
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to
let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.
Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your
cross-references and citations. And please note that the first line of
text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of
all subsequent paragraphs are.

% Always give a unique label

Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first 
lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

Use the standard \verb|equation| environment to typeset your equations, e.g.
%
\begin{equation}
a \times b = c\;,
\end{equation}
%
however, for multiline equations we recommend to use the \verb|eqnarray| environment.
\begin{eqnarray}
a \times b = c \nonumber\\
\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}=\vec{c}
\label{eq:01}
\end{eqnarray}
